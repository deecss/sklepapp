# Product Availability and Description Fix

## Problem
Products with descriptions were disappearing from the frontend after restarting the Flask application because:
1. The XML parsing process was resetting all products to unavailable
2. There was no mechanism to preserve product availability and descriptions during restart

## Solution
We implemented several fixes to ensure that product availability and descriptions persist across application restarts:

### 1. Modified the `parse_xml` method in `product_manager.py`
- Added code to preserve product availability settings from existing products
- Added code to preserve product descriptions during XML parsing
- Added logging to track how many products had their availability and descriptions preserved

### 2. Enhanced the `update_product_description` method
- Made products automatically available for sale when a description is added
- Added logging for when a product is automatically made available

### 3. Created management tools
- Created `manage_products.py` script with various functions to:
  - Count and display product statistics
  - Restore availability for products with descriptions
  - Set availability by category or for all products
  - Show category statistics

### 4. Added testing script
- Created `test_availability_persistence.py` to verify that our changes work correctly
- Test confirmed that product availability and descriptions now persist after app restart

## Verification
The test script confirms that all product availability settings and descriptions are preserved during the XML parsing process, which happens when the application restarts.

## Additional Notes
- Products with descriptions are now automatically marked as available for sale
- If needed, the `manage_products.py` script can be used to restore availability for products

## Usage Example
To restore availability for all products with descriptions:
```
python3 manage_products.py restore
```

To check product statistics:
```
python3 manage_products.py count
```
